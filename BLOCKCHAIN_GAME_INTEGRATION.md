# Safari Adventure - Blockchain Game Integration

This document explains how to integrate blockchain-based rewards and asset ownership into your Safari Adventure game, enabling players to earn real economic value through gameplay.

## üåü Features

### 1. **Play-to-Earn Token System**

- **SAFARI Token (ERC-20)**: Players earn tokens for survival time, achievements, and high scores
- **Real-time Rewards**: Tokens are awarded continuously as players progress
- **Milestone System**: Special bonuses for reaching survival and score milestones

### 2. **Achievement NFT System**

- **Dynamic NFT Minting**: Rare achievements automatically mint unique NFTs
- **Rarity System**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary NFTs
- **Rich Metadata**: Each NFT contains game statistics, timestamps, and achievement details

### 3. **Integrated Marketplace**

- **Asset Trading**: Players can buy and sell tokens and NFTs
- **Real Economic Value**: Blockchain ownership enables true asset ownership
- **Marketplace Integration**: Built on your existing SafariMart infrastructure

### 4. **Hedera Blockchain Integration**

- **Fast & Cheap**: Built on Hedera Hashgraph for instant, low-cost transactions
- **Eco-Friendly**: Energy-efficient blockchain technology
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-ready blockchain infrastructure

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Hedera Account**: Create a testnet account at [portal.hedera.com](https://portal.hedera.com)
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up your Hedera credentials
3. **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file with your Hedera credentials:

```bash
# Hedera Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
HEDERA_TESTNET_RPC_URL=https://testnet.hashio.io/api
HEDERA_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Deploy Game Rewards Contracts**:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/SafariGameRewards.ts --network hederaTestnet
```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   The deployment will create three contracts:

- `SafariSurvivalToken`: ERC-20 token for game rewards
- `SafariAchievementNFT`: ERC-721 collection for achievements
- `SafariGameRewards`: Main rewards management contract

### Frontend Integration

The blockchain integration is already built into your game components:

1. **Game Integration**: The `BlockchainGameUI` component handles wallet connection and rewards
2. **Real-time Rewards**: The `RealtimeRewards` component shows live milestone progress
3. **Marketplace**: The game assets marketplace enables trading

## üéÆ How It Works

### Game Flow

1. **Player Connects Wallet**: Players connect their Hedera wallet to the game
2. **Start Earning Session**: Blockchain session begins when game starts
3. **Real-time Rewards**: Players earn tokens for survival time and achievements
4. **Milestone Rewards**: Special NFTs are minted for significant achievements
5. **Trade Assets**: Players can list earned assets on the marketplace

### Token Economics

#### SAFARI Token Rewards

- **Survival Time**: 1 SAFARI per minute survived
- **Score Bonus**: 0.1 SAFARI per 100 points
- **Achievement Bonus**: 0.5-50 SAFARI per achievement
- **Minimum Survival**: 30 seconds to earn rewards

#### NFT Minting Conditions

- **Safari Master**: Survive 5+ minutes (Legendary NFT)
- **Endurance Runner**: Survive 3+ minutes (Epic NFT)
- **High Scorer**: 500+ points (Rare NFT)
- **Random Drops**: 10% chance for 2+ minute survivors

### Achievement System

The game tracks various achievements that trigger NFT rewards:

```typescript
const achievements = {
  FIRST_SURVIVOR: "Survive your first minute",
  SPEED_DEMON: "High-speed survival mastery",
  COLLISION_MASTER: "Survive multiple collisions",
  ENDURANCE_RUNNER: "Survive for 3+ minutes",
  SAFARI_MASTER: "Legendary 5+ minute survival",
};
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

#### SafariSurvivalToken.sol

```solidity
// ERC-20 token with game-specific features
contract SafariSurvivalToken is ERC20, Ownable, Pausable {
    mapping(address => bool) public gameContracts;
    mapping(address => uint256) public playerTotalEarned;

    function rewardPlayer(address player, uint256 amount, string reason) external;
}
```

#### SafariAchievementNFT.sol

```solidity
// ERC-721 NFT collection for achievements
contract SafariAchievementNFT is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    struct Achievement {
        string achievementType;
        uint256 survivalTime;
        uint256 score;
        string rarity;
    }

    function mintAchievement(address player, ...) external returns (uint256);
}
```

#### SafariGameRewards.sol

```solidity
// Main rewards management contract
contract SafariGameRewards is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    function startGameSession(address player) external returns (bytes32);
    function endGameSession(bytes32 sessionId, ...) external;
}
```

### Frontend Components

#### BlockchainGameUI.tsx

- Wallet connection interface
- Real-time balance display
- Session management
- Reward notifications

#### RealtimeRewards.tsx

- Live milestone tracking
- Floating reward animations
- Progress visualization
- Achievement notifications

#### GameMarketplace.tsx

- Asset browsing and filtering
- Purchase functionality
- Listing creation
- Rarity-based UI

## üîß Configuration

### Game Rewards Configuration

Adjust reward parameters in `SafariGameRewards.sol`:

```solidity
uint256 public constant TOKENS_PER_MINUTE = 100; // 1 SAFARI per minute
uint256 public constant TOKENS_PER_100_SCORE = 10; // 0.1 SAFARI per 100 points
uint256 public constant MIN_SURVIVAL_TIME = 30; // 30 seconds minimum
```

### NFT Rarity Configuration

Configure achievement rarities in the NFT contract:

```solidity
achievementRarities["First Survivor"] = "common";
achievementRarities["Speed Demon"] = "uncommon";
achievementRarities["Collision Master"] = "rare";
achievementRarities["Endurance Runner"] = "epic";
achievementRarities["Safari Master"] = "legendary";
```

### Marketplace Integration

Connect to your existing SafariMart contract:

```typescript
// In GameMarketplace.tsx
const handlePurchase = async (itemId: string, price: number) => {
  // Integrate with your SafariMart.purchaseProduct function
  const result = await safariMartContract.purchaseProduct(itemId, {
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther(price.toString()),
  });
};
```

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Transaction Tracking

All blockchain transactions are logged with:

- Player address
- Reward amount
- Achievement type
- Transaction hash
- Timestamp

### Game Analytics

Track player engagement through:

- Session duration
- Tokens earned per session
- Achievement completion rates
- Marketplace activity

### Example Analytics Query

```typescript
// Get player statistics
const playerStats = await safariGameRewards.getPlayerSessions(playerAddress);
const tokenBalance = await safariSurvivalToken.balanceOf(playerAddress);
const nftCount = await safariAchievementNFT.balanceOf(playerAddress);
```

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### Testnet Deployment

1. **Deploy Contracts**:

```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/SafariGameRewards.ts --network hederaTestnet
```

2. **Update Frontend Configuration**:

```typescript
// Update contract addresses in your frontend
const SAFARI_TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0x...";
const SAFARI_NFT_ADDRESS = "0x...";
const GAME_REWARDS_ADDRESS = "0x...";
```

3. **Test Integration**:

- Connect wallet
- Play game for 60+ seconds
- Verify token rewards
- Check for NFT minting

### Mainnet Deployment

1. **Security Audit**: Conduct thorough security audit of smart contracts
2. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to mainnet with limited initial supply
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track transaction costs and user adoption
4. **Scale Gradually**: Increase reward rates based on player feedback
